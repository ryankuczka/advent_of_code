# Advent of Code

This repo contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/). A fun
site with new programming puzzles every day leading up to Christmas like an advent calendar! :D

So far, all solutions have been done in Python and I plan to re-do most of them in C++ and
possibly other languages hopefully to start learning different things.

### Python Solutions

All solutions are python 2, although some may work in python 3 (maybe another fun thing to do?)

```bash
python dayXX/dayXX.py
```

### C++ Solutions

These are my first ever projects done in C++. To compile/run them:

```bash
cd dayXX
g++ -std=c++0x dayXX.cpp -o dayXX
./dayXX
```
